# Meme OCR GUI Status

## ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

### 1. Gradio File Access Error
**Problem:** Gradio couldn't access image files for search results due to security restrictions.

**Solution:** 
- Added `allowed_paths=[str(memes_path)]` to the launch configuration
- Implemented temp directory copying in `search_memes()` method
- Images are copied to temporary directory that Gradio can access

### 2. Encoding Issues
**Problem:** Unicode emoji characters causing syntax errors in Python.

**Solution:**
- Added `# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-` to file header
- Replaced all emoji characters with text equivalents
- Fixed numpy type hint that wasn't properly imported

### 3. Current Processing Files Display
**Problem:** User requested to see which files are currently being processed.

**Solution:**
- Added "Currently Processing" section to status updates
- Shows up to 5 current files being processed
- Displays "... +N more" when batch size exceeds 5

### 4. Refresh Button Alignment
**Problem:** User requested vertical centering of refresh stats button.

**Solution:**
- Added CSS flexbox styling for `.refresh-button-container`
- Button is now vertically centered in its container
